# Assignment

### Problem statement for Python developer position:

Create Python code which subscribe to the websocket feed to get the latest transactions from arbitrum sequencer. Show your txns in a log file.

There is a bit of reading material that the candidate needs to go through before actually getting to the coding part. 

- Architecture of Ethereum blockchain?
- Read about what is REST, websocket. What are their use-cases & their limitations?
- Read about arbitrum architecture. How does sequencers, relayers works & communication with ethereum happens?
- And how does sync/async websocket works. what's the difference b/w them etc.
- After doing the above, you're expected to code in python for the following:
   
   **Plus points for**:
   - Do it for both L2s i.e. Arbitrum & Optimism.
   - try to make use of **async** code flow in your script and get both arb & optmism txns using the same script in async fashion. Code should be non-blocking in nature.
